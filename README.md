## Source Datafiles
* _ACS 2015-19_: The five year aggregation of the American Community Survey for 2015 through 2019. Downloaded from [IPUMS USA](usa.ipums.org)
* _2020 population data_: [2020 Decennial Census](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/rdo/summary-files.html). The data were downloaded from [Social Explorer](socialexplorer.com).
* _Summary data by PUMA_: Downloaded from [Social Explorer](socialexplorer.com), which has a $100/month subscription fee. The data are also available without cost at [IPUMS NHGIS](www.nhgis.org).
* _Individual PUMA maps and their descriptive titles_: Accessed at [Census.gov/Census Reference Maps/2010 Census Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) Reference Maps](census.gov/geographies/reference-mxaps/2010/geo/2010-PUMAs.html). These maps consist of a single PUMA showing towns and cities within the PUMA.
* _PUMA maps in national context_: Both Social Explorer and NHGIS use the PUMA as a geography for national maps, enabling comparison of PUMA borders and CBSA borders.
* _Google Maps_: [Google Maps](google.com/maps) was used to assess the relationship of the towns in a PUMA to nearby urban areas. 

## Nomenclature

* _Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA)_: In the words of the Census Bureau, PUMAs “are non-overlapping, statistical geographic areas that partition each state or equivalent entity into geographic areas containing no fewer than 100,000 people each.” Borders of the PUMAs are revised every ten years by an agency or commission in each state.
* _Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA)_: The Census Bureau defines urban areas in terms of a core city and adjacent territory that has “a high degree of social and economic integration with the core as measured by commuting ties.” 
* _Metropolitan or Micropolitan Area (MSA)_: A metropolitan area has at least one urbanized area with a population of 50,000 or more. A micropolitan area has at least one urban cluster of at least 10,000 but fewer than 50,000 total population. The current configuration has 707 MSAs. A single CBSA may contain several MSAs. The record is 18, in the CBSA labeled “Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim.” 
* _Principal City_: The Census Bureau assigns one Principal City to each MSA. The Principal City is supposed to represent the focal point for social and economic integration in the immediate area.
